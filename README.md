## Key Features

- **In-Game Stat Command (`/sc`):**  
  Check detailed stats for any player in any gamemode directly from your chat, complete with an ASCII art avatar.

- **Advanced Friend Notifications (`/superf`):**  
  Track specific "super friends." Get custom, multi-line notifications when they log in or out. When they join, their stats for your predefined gamemodes are automatically fetched and displayed.

- **Party Stat Check (`/psc`):**  
  Instantly get a statistical overview (Bedwars stats) of all members in your current party to assess team strength.

- **Modern Desktop Launcher:**  
  A sleek, standalone launcher to manage the proxy, view logs, and access tools without cluttering your game.
  - **Start & Stop Control:** Easily launch and stop the proxy with a single click.
  - **Live Log & Chat Monitor:** Keep an eye on system logs and the in-game chat in real-time.
  - **Integrated Settings:** Manage your API key, command aliases, and other settings directly within the launcher.
  - **Player Search Tools:** Look up detailed player stats and online status for any player on Hypixel.

- **Secure & Local:**  
  The proxy runs entirely on your own machine. Your Minecraft account details are handled by the official `minecraft-protocol` library for authentication and are never sent to a third party.

## How to Use

### 1. Starting JagProx

You have two ways to run the application:

**A) Using the Desktop Launcher (Recommended)**
This provides a full user interface to control the proxy and access all features.

```bash
npm run launcher
```

**B) Running the Proxy Only (Headless)**
This will start the proxy in your terminal without the user interface.

```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Connecting in Minecraft

1. Launch Minecraft (**1.8.9 recommended**).
2. Go to `Multiplayer` â†’ `Add Server`.
3. For the **Server Address**, enter:
   ```
   localhost:2107
   ```
   (or whichever port you configured in `config.yml`)
4. Save the server and connect to it. You will be automatically logged into Hypixel through the proxy.
